                    How many times you find your self explaining to some clueless random guy who think some NBA player
                    is better than another? How many times you explained to your dad or some other Boomer that old school players are NOT
                    better the today's youngsters. How many times you had to explain to your son or his "know it all" friends that the NBA today is NOT what it
                    used to be? Well... you should look no further.
                    <br><br>Here you can build your lists of 'best players' and show off your knowledge. All you need to do is <a href="/login">login</a> goto <a href="/players">players</a> and start
                    ranking and who know, maybe your list wil get the most votes.
